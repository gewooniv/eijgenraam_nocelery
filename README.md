# Eijgenraam.net

This is a project to share insights of our family history and genealogy with others. The current website is outdated and to be replaced by this one.

The current requirements are:
* an admin panel to add posts/articles
* a link and clear description to our family tree (external site)
* a comment section below posts
* a guestbook

The project is currently hosted in a Docker container on an Ubuntu machine in the Oracle cloud. By using the Oracle cloud free tier, we are provided two (forever) free VM's. The project is built using Cookiecutter, a framework for jumpstarting production-ready Django projects quickly. Additional information can be found [here](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django/).

It's possible that the demo [site](https://eijgenra.am/) is down or has little content. This is because of the testing being done by the users and the active development. It's also possible that we have requested too many SSL-certificates in the last couple of days. This is because the production environment is not yet stable. Therefor you might receive some warnings.
